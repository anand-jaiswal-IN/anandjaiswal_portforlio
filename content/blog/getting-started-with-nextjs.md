# Getting Started with Next.js: A Complete Guide

Next.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications. As a full-stack React framework, it provides everything you need to build fast, SEO-friendly web applications with minimal configuration.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications. By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

## Key Features

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Next.js provides built-in server-side rendering, which means your pages are rendered on the server before being sent to the client. This improves SEO and initial page load performance.

### 2. Static Site Generation (SSG)
You can pre-render pages at build time, creating static HTML files that can be served from a CDN for lightning-fast performance.

### 3. API Routes
Build your backend API directly within your Next.js application using API routes. No need for a separate server!

### 4. File-based Routing
Create pages by simply adding files to the `pages` directory. Next.js automatically handles the routing for you.

## Getting Started

Let's create a new Next.js application:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Next.js application and start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project structure looks like this:

```
my-app/
├── pages/
│   ├── api/
│   ├── _app.js
│   └── index.js
├── public/
├── styles/
├── package.json
└── next.config.js
```

## Creating Your First Page

Create a new file `pages/about.js`:

```jsx
export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>This is the about page.</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/about` to see your new page!

## Data Fetching

Next.js provides several methods for fetching data:

### getStaticProps
Use this for static generation with data:

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const posts = await data.json()

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}
```

### getServerSideProps
Use this for server-side rendering:

```jsx
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const posts = await data.json()

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}
```

## Styling

Next.js supports various styling options:

- **CSS Modules**: Scoped CSS by default
- **Styled JSX**: Built-in CSS-in-JS solution
- **Sass**: Built-in Sass support
- **CSS-in-JS**: Support for popular libraries like styled-components

## Deployment

Deploying a Next.js application is straightforward. The easiest way is to use Vercel (created by the same team):

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy with zero configuration!

## Best Practices

1. **Use TypeScript**: Next.js has excellent TypeScript support
2. **Optimize Images**: Use the built-in `next/image` component
3. **Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically splits your code
4. **SEO**: Use the `next/head` component for meta tags

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern React applications. Its built-in optimizations, developer experience, and deployment options make it a powerful framework for both beginners and experienced developers.

Start building your next project with Next.js today and experience the difference!
